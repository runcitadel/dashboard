      Thank you for using Citadel! As you probably know, we're a completely free

      features and to make it better, we need your support.<br />

      free, like <a href="https://sats4.me">sats4.me</a>, automated backups of
      your Lightning channels, the Nirvati Container registry, and more.<br />
