        Thank you for using Citadel! As you probably know, we're a completely
        free (as in free speech) open source project.<br />
        To make it possible for us to spend more time on Citadel, build more
        features and to make it better, we need your support.<br />
        Your support also helps us to continue offering other services to you
        for free, like Lightning addresses @ln.runcitadel.space and automated
        backups of your Lightning channels.<br />
        <br />
        If you want to donate to us over Lightning or on-chain, please visit
